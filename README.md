# üè¶ Credit Loan Repayment Prediction

A full-stack data science project to predict whether a bank loan will be repaid, using a trained machine learning model served via an API. Users can interact with the model through a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project uses a machine learning model trained on credit application data to predict the probability of loan repayment. It provides:

- A RESTful API to serve predictions (`FastAPI`, deployed on Heroku)
- A web interface for CSV upload and prediction (`Streamlit`)
- Versioned model management using `MLflow`

---

## üß† Model Pipeline

The model was trained on historical loan data with features such as:
- Applicant income
- Loan amount
- Credit history
- Employment status
- ...

Pipeline includes:
- Preprocessing (imputation, encoding, scaling)
- Class imbalance handling (e.g., SMOTE)
- Model training (XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM)
- Evaluation (F1-score, customized score, ROC AUC, SHAP explainability)
